# SC1015_A128_team7_MiniProject

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on predicting the risk of contracting cardiovascular diseases based on health data using Data Science and Machine Learning.

## Background
-input the cardiovascular disease importance and stats etc.

## Objective
Our objective is to accurately predict the risk of a person contracting cardiovascular diseases based on parameters from their health and personal data.

## What's Included
1. Our cardiovascular disease dataset
2. Our presentation slides
3. Our Jupyter Notebook for our project
    - Data preparation and cleaning
    - Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Machine Learning
      1) Random Forest Model
      2) K-Nearest Neighbour Model

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Machine Learning
We subjected the dataset to a 80-20 train-test split.
Then we subjected the data to the Random Forest Model as well as the K-Nearest Neighbour Model.
1. Random Forest Classifier:
        - Random Forest is ameta estimator that fits decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
2. K-Nearest Neighbour
        - K-Nearest Neigbour is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.


## Conclusion
1. We recommend that health services can collect relevant patient health data and subject the data to machine learning models to better predict their cardiovascular diseases risk for early intervention. 
2. The most significant factors in predicting cardiovascular diseases were blood pressure, cholesterol level and BMI.
